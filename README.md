# Pyserial-Image-Sending-Receiving
Sending images through pyserial on VSPE
Code from a year ago
In tx opens and sends images converted in a bytearray through a serial port
rx receives it, divides the images and open one image of their preference through opening an ioBytes image with PIL,
editing the code could open all of them or join them together

Doing a second repository with the same pyserial and bytearray combination but opening the PIL image in Pygame
